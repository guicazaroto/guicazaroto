I am a software developer and frontend specialist with over 10 years of experience.

I consider myself a Full Stack developer capable of participating in the entire software development and engineering process, from requirements gathering, prototyping, and coding (both backend and frontend) to DevOps processes and application monitoring.

Throughout my career, I have chosen to specialize in frontend development and have worked with leading tools in this area, such as React, VueJs, Angular, and JQuery. I have also worked with UI libraries like Tailwind, MUI, Bootstrap, Materialize, and Vuetify. Therefore, most of my time has been focused on the client side.

In addition, I have worked on server-side applications using PHP (Laravel), NodeJs (Express), C# (MVC 4), Ruby on Rails, and ASP 3. I have utilized databases such as MongoDB, Postgres, and MySql.

I have experience with various cloud platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, and have dealt with CI/CD processes, integrating with these platforms using tools like Github Actions, Docker, among others.

I am also capable of planning scalable architectures using DDD, clean architecture, unit testing, linters, bundling tools, automation scripts, modular and micro front-end, and the latest market practices.

Other skills I have developed over the years include knowledge of UX design and its heuristics. I have undertaken activities to improve interfaces to make them more intuitive for users.

As a developer, my main goal is to build the interface designed by the UX/UI team with the highest possible fidelity, writing performant, easy-to-understand, and maintainable code. I strive to find the best practices and coding standards, as a well-planned interface ensures that the code endures over the years.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. Additionally, I am passionate about music, cinema, and literature.
